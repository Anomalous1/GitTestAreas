# Test: using git to put file on github

========================

This is new branch thisisbranch

=======================

For another branch...
"Snapshots" of files are stored on git.

For reference.
After merging histories of two branches, the branches are left. It is possible
to delete the branch that is no longer needed after merge.
I'm unsure how it works when two branches are both modified. What if the same two files
have been modified differently on two branches? What happens after merge...?
